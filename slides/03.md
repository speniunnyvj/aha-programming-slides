# Takeaways

- DRY is not necessarily a bad thing
- You cannot tell the future: optimize for change
- Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction, so prefer duplication
  over the wrong abstraction - Sandi Metz
- Wait for commonalities in duplicate code to scream at you for abstraction.
- If you have "shared code" with lots of branches then resist the urge to add
  more conditionals to it. Refactor it first.
